#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
<!-- a = 0  complexity of O(1)
    while (a < n * n * n): complexity of O(3n)
      a = a + n * n     complexity of O(1)
      
      O(1) + (O(n) * O(1)) --> 

    I believe the first question has a complexity of O(n). When the lines are multiplied the value of O(3n) can be reduced to just O(n)

b)
<!-- sum = 0   complexity of O(1)
    for i in range(n): complexity of O(n)
      j = 1 Complexity 
      while j < n:
        j *= 2
        sum += 1 -->


c)
