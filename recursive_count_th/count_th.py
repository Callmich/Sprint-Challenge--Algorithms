'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
'''
def count_th(word):
    # Need to set a base case - in this case I think it would be best to be moving the string closer to 1 character as it cannot have a th if there is only one character

    # Next I think I want to return the recursion. in this case I think it would be best to run the same function but just eliminating the first character of the string of the string

    # if the first two characters of the string are th we can return 1
    
    
    pass
